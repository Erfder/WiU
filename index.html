    <p>This is some text about the project. The rubric says it must contain relevant information (and see b2, which I couldn't find anything pertaining to this assignment in), but the assignment says it can be about anything. So this page contains informative links and whatnot below. This paragraph may change at any point during the course to be more relevant.</p>
